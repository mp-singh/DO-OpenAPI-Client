## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**autovacuum_freeze_max_age** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the maximum age (in transactions) that a table's pg_class.relfrozenxid field can attain before a VACUUM operation is forced to prevent transaction ID wraparound within the table. Note that the system will launch autovacuum processes to prevent wraparound even when autovacuum is otherwise disabled. This parameter will cause the server to be restarted. | [optional]
**autovacuum_max_workers** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the maximum number of autovacuum processes (other than the autovacuum launcher) that may be running at any one time. The default is three. This parameter can only be set at server start. | [optional]
**autovacuum_naptime** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the minimum delay, in seconds, between autovacuum runs on any given database. The default is one minute. | [optional]
**autovacuum_vacuum_threshold** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the minimum number of updated or deleted tuples needed to trigger a VACUUM in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. | [optional]
**autovacuum_analyze_threshold** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the minimum number of inserted, updated, or deleted tuples needed to trigger an ANALYZE in any one table. The default is 50 tuples. | [optional]
**autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor** | Option<**f32**> | Specifies a fraction, in a decimal value, of the table size to add to autovacuum_vacuum_threshold when deciding whether to trigger a VACUUM. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). | [optional]
**autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor** | Option<**f32**> | Specifies a fraction, in a decimal value, of the table size to add to autovacuum_analyze_threshold when deciding whether to trigger an ANALYZE. The default is 0.2 (20% of table size). | [optional]
**autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the cost delay value, in milliseconds, that will be used in automatic VACUUM operations. If -1, uses the regular vacuum_cost_delay value, which is 20 milliseconds. | [optional]
**autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the cost limit value that will be used in automatic VACUUM operations. If -1 is specified (which is the default), the regular vacuum_cost_limit value will be used. | [optional]
**backup_hour** | Option<**i32**> | The hour of day (in UTC) when backup for the service starts. New backup only starts if previous backup has already completed. | [optional]
**backup_minute** | Option<**i32**> | The minute of the backup hour when backup for the service starts. New backup is only started if previous backup has already completed. | [optional]
**bgwriter_delay** | Option<**i32**> | Specifies the delay, in milliseconds, between activity rounds for the background writer. Default is 200 ms. | [optional]
**bgwriter_flush_after** | Option<**i32**> | The amount of kilobytes that need to be written by the background writer before attempting to force the OS to issue these writes to underlying storage. Specified in kilobytes, default is 512.  Setting of 0 disables forced writeback. | [optional]
**bgwriter_lru_maxpages** | Option<**i32**> | The maximum number of buffers that the background writer can write. Setting this to zero disables background writing. Default is 100. | [optional]
**bgwriter_lru_multiplier** | Option<**f32**> | The average recent need for new buffers is multiplied by bgwriter_lru_multiplier to arrive at an estimate of the number that will be needed during the next round, (up to bgwriter_lru_maxpages). 1.0 represents a “just in time” policy of writing exactly the number of buffers predicted to be needed. Larger values provide some cushion against spikes in demand, while smaller values intentionally leave writes to be done by server processes. The default is 2.0. | [optional]
**deadlock_timeout** | Option<**i32**> | The amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait on a lock before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. | [optional]
**default_toast_compression** | Option<**String**> | Specifies the default TOAST compression method for values of compressible columns (the default is lz4). | [optional]

**log_min_duration_statement** | Option<**i32**> | Log statements that take more than this number of milliseconds to run. If -1, disables. | [optional]
